    "RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment Suite) is an open-source framework designed to systematically evaluate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. It measures key aspects of performance including faithfulness (factual grounding), answer relevancy, context precision, context recall, and overall answer correctness. By combining LLM-based evaluations with traditional retrieval metrics, RAGAS provides a structured and quantitative way to assess how well a RAG system retrieves relevant information and generates accurate, context-based answers."
